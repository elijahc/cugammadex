# Intern Information

*Dominic Royster MD, Kenji Tanabe MD, Kelsey Repine MD*

Welcome to CU Anesthesiology! We are so excited to have you join us this year! Below is a starter to give you some idea of what is to come this year.  We are excited to welcome you to the Department of Anesthesia and to work with you to make this year as educational and integrated as possible!  We are continually seeking to optimize the learning opportunities and experience of the year, so please don’t hesitate to reach out to any of us if you have any questions or suggestions. 

## INTERN YEAR BREAKDOWN:

- 5 Anesthesia-related months
  - 2 months [UCH OR Anesthesia](../r/uch)
  - 1 month [CTICU](../r/cticu)
  - 1 month [STICU](../r/sticu)
  - 1 month [Acute Pain Service](../r/aps)
  - 1 month [Pre-Procedure Services](../r/pps)

- 3 Surgery months
- 2 Medicine-based months (1 month IM Wards at the VA, 1 month cardiology at UCH) 
- 1 ED month

**1 Intern Week** – last week of intern year (Unpaid, but no clinical duties the week immediately prior to starting CA1 Year)  

## EDUCATION FUNDS AND CONFERENCES
As an intern, you have two different categories of educational funds available to you: 

1) Discretionary Educational Funds: All PGY-1 residents will receive up to $500 of discretionary funds per year.  These can be used for any educational materials except for exam registration fees (i.e. USMLE Step 3 registration).   

2) Scholarly Presentation Funds: In the event a PGY-1 resident presents scholarly work at a meeting, the resident can apply to the department (Residency PD, VC Education, Education Manager) for travel support. Up to $1500 per year may be awarded depending on the nature of the presentation and meeting details. Note: Since any funds awarded are for specific presentation/trip, they do not rollover and these funds cannot be used for other purposes. 

 
Interns are allotted a maximum of 2 non-clinical education days throughout the year to attend a conference at which they are presenting (must be presenting to use these days).  Rotations where obtaining non-clinical time to attend a conference is feasible include your anesthesiology OR rotation, CTICU, and STICU.  For APS and PPS, conference attendance may be feasible, but this requires 3-month advanced notice for planning. For EM, conference attendance can take place between scheduled clinical shifts.  Conference attendance is not feasible during internal medicine and surgical rotations. 

## STEP 3 AND ITE

Step 3 should be completed by the end of March of your intern year. For ease of scheduling,  please take the exam on anesthesia-based rotations (i.e. STICU, CTICU, APS, PPS, OR Anesthesiology). 

 
As noted above, you will have available a total of $500 for discretionary educational funds (i.e. study materials).  You will need to show a receipt to the education department and these funds can only be used for study materials. As a word of general advice, don’t use it to pay for a full year of Uworld - you don’t have time for that. Most IM intern groups will have discounted group buy-ins for ~$400 for 6 months Uworld.  


The Inservice Training Exam (ITE) is an anesthesiology knowledge-based test. You will sit this exam in early February each year from Intern to CA-3. As an intern, you are not expected to study for this exam nor will your scores matter. Your priorities are Step 3, learning to become a doctor, and starting to prepare for anesthesiology residency. CA-1 and beyond it is highly encouraged to perform well as this assessment reflects your anesthesia knowledge with each passing year.
