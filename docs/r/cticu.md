# CTICU at UCH

### Important People


## Overview
The CTICU is split up between two provider teams (Red/Blue) each with their own attending. Attendings rotate
on a weekly basis changing over each Monday. The attendings alternate days for admissions. You will bounce
between teams (sometimes split between teams) based on which patients you are assigned. Typically, the APPs
will send out a text the night before with the next day’s patient assignments. Generally, the CTICU is well
staffed. You will typically be assigned 3-4 patients during the day. 

## Daily Workflow
*Fellow rounds:* Arrive around 5:45 – 6:00 AM depending on the census. I overnight resident will have
printed off a sign out list for you and filled in many of the numbers (Vitals, Swan numbers, I/Os) The
overnight residents/APP will then present all the cardiac patients on fellow rounds. The night resident 
will briefly present cardiac patients ONLY to the cardiac fellow. – There you will
hear a brief daily plan from the fellow/night resident. Thereafter, the night resident
will give sign out on the rest of the unit patients (Thoracic and Vascular patients)
and answer any questions.

*Pre-rounds*: You then have time between fellow rounds and attending rounds to completely lookup and
familiarize yourself with your patients. Including: talking to their RN, performing a quick and focused
exam, reviewing patient data (labs, I/Os) in EPIC, starting the daily progress note and write any urgent
orders (transfuse, electrolytes replacement, etc.); always try to glance at the daily CXR before rounds.
Make sure everyone is seen by the time rounds start.

## Shifts
There are rare days where you will be assigned more or less. There are several different shifts you will work.
Weekday rounding (6AM-4PM), Admitting M-F (10AM-10PM), Weekday night call (4PM-7AM), Weekend
24h call (7AM-7AM) 


## Call Schedule
It isQ4 call in the CTICU. Weekday call shifts start @ 4 pm. You will get sign-out from the day team and then
cross-cover those patients until the morning. The weekday admitter will sign out the days new admits to you
around 10 PM (potentially earlier if it is slow). You will present the cardiac patients at fellow rounds in the
morning and sign out thoracic patients directly to the day resident/APP covering those patients. For weekend
24h call you arrive on Sat/Sun at 7AM with fellow rounds shortly to follow. The overnight resident is then
allowed to go home, and the day resident and one or more APP split up the unit. The APP will typically stay
until around 4pm on weekends when a general surgery moonlighter arrives, at that point you re-distribute the
unit for overnight coverage.
