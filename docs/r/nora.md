# Non-OR Anesthesia (NORA)
## Overview
More and more, anesthesia providers are asked to care for patients outside of traditional OR settings. This Non-Operating Room Anesthesia (NORA) rotation exposes you to these environments where anesthesia is provided to complex patients (GI, CV, IR, MRI, CT). In the past, the proceduralist provided the sedation, but has become not always adequate or safe as the complexity and acuity of patients continues to increase. As more advanced and complex procedures are introduced with ever-expanding indications and sicker patients, the need for Anesthesia services increases. Patients who previously were considered poor candidates for high-risk invasive procedures are now receiving these equally high-risk but minimally invasive procedures. Coordinating patient care in these settings is a challenge, not only because of the type of procedures and patient population, but also due to working with different non-OR team members in an unfamiliar environment, often lacking equipment anesthesia providers are accustomed to in the OR.

Cases may or may not start strictly on-time because of the coordination of other providers and specific equipment. As always, try to be available and ready for when they do decide to start the case. One dedicated anesthesia tech covers the NORA cases; however, they are typically also turning over rooms in the main OR. If you need special equipment, collect it for your first case, or notify them early on. Communication is incredibly important as you will be engaging with different RNs and physicians. Ask questions and make your needs known.
For your daily assignment, please refer to the daily schedule email sent out. Sometimes, you will have to look past the cover sheet into the actual room assignments. Occasionally, your room assignment with be listed on the preprocedure tab in the top right along with the name of the procedure being done.

For this chapter, locations will be covered one by one given the distinct differences in workflow and locations.

## MRI
You may anesthetize patients in the MRI adjacent to OR 25 (3T) or in the basement MRI (1.5T). You need to fill out an MRI screening form annually while in residency that will be kept on file. If you have not done this, arrive early to one of the MRI rooms and notify the MRI tech, and they will be able to get you the paperwork to be allowed to enter the MRI. They will give you a small card to designate you have done this – it’s good for a year, put it with your badge so you always have it!

Prior to entering the MRI room, don’t forget to remove ALL metal objects as well as other things that will be damaged by the magnet; you can leave these in the control room. The MRI Tech will typically have a plastic bucket for you to place your belongings. This includes many things that you may not even think of (pens, bobby pins/hair clips, watches, cell phone, all credit cards or badges, etc.). Oddly enough, rings and the needles on your syringes are ok.

The MRI tech will always be present when you have access to the MRI room. In the basement, there is usually a tech around; however, they only come up for scheduled scans (with or without our involvement) upstairs. The phone number to the upstairs control room is x81690. The anesthesia tech also relies on the MRI tech to get into the room to set up your machine and cart.

### Pre-op:
- Make sure the patient has filled out their MRI screening form before you give any sedation and go back to the room. Many of these patients are receiving anesthesia because they are claustrophobic. No proceduralist will be there because the scan was ordered by an outpatient provider.
- Non-sedated patients can walk into the MRI suite and get onto the bed themselves. Otherwise, park the gurney in the control room, the MRI tech will bring the MRI bed out and then help you wheel that in once the patient is on it. You will typically induce on this bed next to the MRI, the tech can help lower/raise/etc.
### Monitors
There are instructions on which monitor to enter into MonCap on the computer (UCHOR iMRI). This will not acquire your vitals unless the screen in the control room is turned on. Many of these monitors have special components to them (I.e., MRI safe EKG stickers, finger pulse ox probe is specific to the wireless monitor, etc.). Just ask the MRI techs to help you locate these if you cannot find them.

### During the scan
Once the scan has started, you may be able to enter the room between sequences, however if something happens in the middle of a sequence, the only way to get to the patient (administer meds, etc.) is to interrupt it then restart from the beginning once you’re done. Be sure to communicate with the MRI tech if there’s something you need, and they will pause/stop for you.

### Misc
- The MRI compatible pump is a giant pain. There are instructions for troubleshooting that should be with it. If possible, have someone walk you through getting it set up and get it working well before you actually need to use it. Typically, if you are running infusions, you just leave a non-MRI compatible pump outside the actual MRI room and run long extension tubing (ask the MRI tech for this tubing).
- Make sure to ask the MRI techs for the extra-long IV extension tubing if using the non-MRI compatible pump outside the room. Do keep in mind that this tubing has about 12 cc of fluid between the pump and the patient and as such changes made on the pump take a while to get to the patient unless you crank up the rate of your carrier

### PACU
You must call PACU at 86203 to let them know you are bringing your patient to them. In the OR, typically the circulator RN handles this for you. Call 15-20 min before you anticipate arriving. They will want to know the patient's name and whether they are going home after recovery.

::: tip
If it is your first day there or you feel uncomfortable, let the MRI techs know! They are incredibly helpful, and they will help you through the day and all the small but important nuances of MRI safety.

## Radiology
> Aka the basement

You will sometimes go downstairs to the basement to sedate patients for LP or for procedures in the CT scanner. Overall, this is very similar to MRI (and the 1.5T MRI is down here, as discussed above), however you have access to these rooms without a tech. Make sure you have lead for yourself, particularly for the CT ablations and things where you’ll be in and out during the procedure and scanning. Don't give sedation until you're downstairs (often the proceduralist has not consented while your patient is in preop even though you have). These monitors don't always pull vitals into Epic, when this is the case, you will have to chart everything manually.

::: tip
As above, call PACU at 86203 to let them know to expect you. Depending on the procedure pre/post may be on the 2nd floor by the ORs or on 3 by CVC.
:::

- Talk to your attendings about positioning specific to the procedure – sometimes it’ll be a surprise (i.e., radiology likes to have patients prone for LPs).
- The anesthesia tech will set up your machine and cart. They usually know when things are scheduled here but check in and keep them updated if scheduling changes. I would suggest calling them first thing of that day.

## GI
GI is adjacent to the East ORs. There are a couple of suites as well as a small pre/post area between the GI suites and the East OR.
- Medications:
	- The AOP pharmacy covers this area, their phone number is 81391. Similar to East OR, in the morning the pharmacy will have med bags pre-prepared for all your booked cases. You can pick up some or all bags in the morning, just remember that you can expect very fast room turnovers (~20 min), so find a system to keep up with administering and wasting medications for the correct patient, including when you get a break, or your attending gets something out of the top drawer.
- Some cases are simply done on the patient’s gurney while others will be done on a procedure table. The anesthesia tech will turn over your room, their number is on the anesthesia machine.
- As with some subspecialties, there are some minor differences in the anesthesia carts here (Unasyn instead of Ancef, glucagon in top drawer, albumin 500cc in bottom drawer).
- In general, you can anticipate to performing GETAs for: ERCPs and small bowel endoscopies. You will typically perform MAC for EGDs, colonoscopy, and some stent removals, however, as always, ultimately this depends on the pertinent details for that case or patient.

## HVC - IR/EP/Cath lab
The HVC is on AIP2 3rd floor. There are typically four anesthesia teams in this area for a normal day. We may be involved with IR, neuro-IR, interventional cardiology, and EP cases. The CT-guided ablations are typically a HVC team, although these occur in the basement CT scanner. On occasion, we provide anesthesia for vascular surgery, pulmonology (bronchoscopies), MSK (kyphoplasties), and the ECHO cardiology service (sedation for TEE) as well.


The culture in the HVC is quite different than the operating room. If you open a dialogue with folks generally you will find that they are very willing to help, but don’t know what to do. Try to engage the procedure room nurses when you are inducing and emerging. This will help them both learn what you need and allow them to be helpful in the case of emergency. Write your phone number and your attending’s phone number on the white board in the room. While this is the typical practice in the general OR, it is especially important in HVC as your attending can be far away and the rooms are not arranged with the anesthesia team in mind. Unlike in the main OR, the nurses in the HVC usually do not have an up-to-date phone list. It will take time for them to find your attending’s phone number if you need them to call for help!


### EQUIPMENT
Most if not all of the equipment we have available downstairs (Level 1, Belmont, Cmac, glidescope, etc) is also updstairs, but it may take longer to get. If you need it, let your tech know ahead of time! If you run into an emergency, CALL FOR IT EARLY as it will take some time to get there.
::: important
If your room does not have an anesthesia machine or cart when you get there in the morning, just call your tech for assistance.

### Finding stuff
- EP rooms: #11, 12, 13. EP #13 is technically an MRI room. It is a very low Tesla MRI, and the magnet is always on, behave accordingly. Most of your supplies will be in cabinets along the back wall rather than in the anesthesia
machine drawer. To find where you will be working, there's a whiteboard in one of the EP control rooms that will say which doc/case is in which room.
	- IR cases are generally done in 6 or 15.
	- Neuro IR cases are generally done in 7, 8 or 9.
	- If you’re not sure which room you’ll be in, you can just ask at the main desk in the HVC work area in the morning (HINT: the HVC number listed on the OR board does not correlate to the room number).
	- The HVC tech phone is 87967.
### Preop
-  The HVC RN will bring the patient back to the room once they confirm that both the anesthesia and procedure team consents have been done. Often the team does not want pre-medication prior to timeout. Communicate with the in-room RN if you’re not ready for the patient.
### Medications:
- There is a pyxis in Rm 3.2319.; in-between the EP hallway and the hallway to the IR/Cath control room. The door code to 3.2319 is 3231#. If you forget what the code is, just remember is the first 4 numbers of the room number.
- You should plan to get most of the medications and boxes you need from the main OR pharmacy and pyxis.
- Other meds you need when you can’t go back downstairs can be sent to the HVC pre/post tube station, number 687. If you request medications during a case, pharmacy will send it to the tube station rather than walk it to you like in the main OR. Tell one of the nurses that you’re waiting for a medication, and they will check for you. The HVC work area tube station is #645.

### Misc
- Typically, time out is performed prior to starting your anesthetic with the procedure and anesthesia teams. Use this time to confirm that everyone is on the same page if you haven’t already.
- Once you are done with induction / starting sedation, tell the team. They don’t always realize when you’re ready for them to start.
- Specific to EP, when you take over a case, ask for a timeout. Use this as a chance to introduce yourself and review management issues with the EP proceduralist and current (leaving) anesthesia provider. Be sure to discuss any significant BP support being administered. Document the time out in the anesthesia record. ALWAYS wear the headset they give you; this is how everyone communicates, and you will miss important things without it. There have been many near misses when people have not used it. Just make sure that it’s on mute if you are signing out, complaining, etc.
- EP Room 13 has a notoriously bad reputation, because it is technically an MRI room (low-tesla magnet), and the EPIC/Vitals monitor interface is very finnicky, resulting in the need to manually enter vitals. Make sure your attending gives you a primer on the room before you start your case. There is also a laminated “how to EP room 13” sheet on the vent – give it a look over on the first day you're in the room.
	- The EKG monitor and pulse have batteries that can be found in the room. When you arrive in the morning, one of the first things you should do is make sure that that batteries got taken out of the wireless monitors and put on the charger overnight. If not, get them on the charger ASAP. Also, the anesthesia machine in this room is MRI safe and thus not like the typical GE machines found elsewhere. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the machine the first time you use it.
### Labs:
- For ABGs/ Blood Gas labs, from 0700 – 1900 someone from HVC must walk it to the OR lab (our stat lab personnel from the main OR are not expected to come pick up from HVC) or send it through the tube station; from 1900-0700, call 85309 and someone will walk from Leprino to pick it up. Let the nighttime person know if you will be sending repeated/frequent labs. All TEGs must be walked down, the sample cannot be used if it’s been sent by tube.
### Computers:
- The IP addresses for the data ports on the booms in the HVC expire if not used after 30 days. This means that if you are doing an anesthetic in a room that we don’t use often (like cath lab 5 or cath lab 6) there will not be internet access without a call to the computer help desk. This is primarily an issue for interventional cardiology. IF you see that you are scheduled to do a case in an infrequently used room, such as cath lab 5 or cath lab 6, please reach out ahead of time to the nurses in that area and ask that the data port be issued a new IP address. Interventional Cardiology will try to be pro-active with this, but please do your part by helping folks remember or make the call yourself.
### Supplies:
- The anesthesia equipment room is next to procedure room 1, it is room #3365 (the code to get in is the room number). It should have things like a CMAC, level 1, etc. There are other random anesthesia goodies on a shelf in the back left corner (circuits, tubes, etc.…).
### Positioning:
- Currently the HVC does not have equipment for prone positioning. Some providers make do with blanket rolls if the case is going to be short. Some providers borrow gel roles from the main OR. The HVC is in the process of finding radiolucent gel rolls to purchase. We DO have yellow foam! Some IR beds are equipped with a pull out at the head that allows some neutralization of the C-spine when the patient is in a prone view, as well as a place to rest the arms in a superman position.
### Blood:
- Blood bank will also send things to the HVC work area tube station, #645.
### Post-procedure:
- Non-ICU patients typically go to the HVC pre/post area (CPPR), treat this like PACU. All ICU patients will return to their ICU bed post-procedure. RNs will still bring them to the procedure room; however, you will transport them back.
