## Before you start

You must have your ID badge (use it for parking, getting scrubs and getting through doors), codes for Pyxis (talk to Clark Lyda at the OR Pharmacy window for problems with Log-in), and of course EPIC (which is the same username and password as your UCD webmail. Every time you change this in one system it changes it in the other) 

When in doubt, call Alyson, Aurora, the chiefs, or another resident. We have all been there and can help. Call a resident who is over at the University to give you a tour before starting. 

Pre-ops can be done from home, if you havenâ€™t already done them in the OR. This is accomplished by going to https://myapps.uchealth.org . Bookmark this page on your home computer and it will save you time in the future. Log-in using your webmail username and password. (The first time you log-in you will have to download Citrix to run EPIC. A link is posted for both Windows and Mac operating systems. Click this link and follow the instructions.) To log-in to EPIC PRD icon and log-in with your EPIC (same as webmail) username and password. Go to the OR Status or Snapboard and find your patient cases.
