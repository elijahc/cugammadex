# POCUS Rotation

The ultrasound rotation is a 2 week block, depending on the day you'll either be with the echo techs scanning patients who have had inpatient TTE's ordered, scanning patients in the ED, or doing TEE's in the cardiac OR or CTICU.
 
## Daily Workflow

Varies by day

### Denver health
please coordinate with Dr. Ferrone the afternoon before your scheduled day there – you can email adam.ferrone@cuanschutz.edu or text him
 

### Cardiology
For the days you are in the echo lab, echo techs arrive around 7a and their office is on the third floor between IR/cath lab and outpatient US.  Please meet them at that time. They know which days to expect you.  


### TEE/CTICU
Go to CT OR’s (usually 39 and 40 +/- 31 to 38) and check in with CT anesthesia fellow/attending at normal start time. They will discuss options for going over TEE with you. If there are no TEE cases, or if CT cases wrap up before 2 pm, go to CTICU and speak to the fellow or available attending and they will help you find patients to scan! I will be on service during your first week on the rotation and look forward to scanning with you when possible. 

 
### ED
You will meet with the ED attendings at 10:00 am at the charge desk in the ED. Please reach out to Mair Wallis if you have issues meeting up. These sessions run about 3 hours long.
