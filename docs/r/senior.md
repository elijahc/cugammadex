# Senior Month

This rotation was created to give seniors the opportunity to engage in out-of-OR, attending and pre-tending opportunities. 
Additionally, the Day and night jeopardy rotations are designed so residents are pulled from other educational activities less often. 
This rotation is an opportunity for self-guided, senior level learning, and gives residents the opportunity to drive their experience, so please be proactive in getting what you want out of this experience. 

This month consists of the following breakdown:  

- 1 week at of CT coverage  
- 1-week Senior nights (see senior nights section for details) 
- 1 week Day Jeopardy, “Senior Days” 
- 1 week Night Jeopardy, “Wildcard” 

 

## Day Jeopardy, “Senior Days” 

When you are on your day jeopardy rotation, you are jeopardy Mon-Sun for any day shift for which someone calls out. If you are not called in, you arrive to UCH at 645-7am during the week.  

**Opportunities for the senior day resident:**

- Sign into the airway/trauma pager and responding to codes in the hospital during the day 

- It is expected you respond to trauma and airways (communicate with the lead APP and charge of the day) 

- Field inpatient consults  

- Assist urgent matters in the PACU and perioperative area (e.g., “Anesthesia STAT” calls).  

- Running the board with charge and learn the logistics of that process. 

- Pre-tending with an attending and a junior resident.  

If you are not called to another location, you are relieved at ~3 pm once most of the afternoon board running has been completed (check with charge before you leave). You do not come in on weekends unless called in for a jeopardy shift. 

 

## Night Jeopardy, “Wildcard” 

You are jeopardy Mon-Sun for any night shift for which someone calls out. If you are not called in the night prior, you arrive at 7am. 
If the DAY jeopardy was pulled, you will assume that role (above). 

**Opportunities for the night jeopardy, wildcard resident:**

- Sign into airway and trauma pagers to help the day jeapordy resident as above

- Assist with starting cases/pre-tending for junior residents/helping out where necessary (AKA OB is getting crushed and need a hand or East needs someone to manage all the blocks for the day).  

- Help with difficult airway management if it is occurring in a non-resident room (e.g., attending solo room).  

- Help APS with first start epidurals/blocks. 

If the chief residents find out you are going to be called in for a night shift, you will be sent home as soon as possible to rest for the shift and will not have to come in during the day the next day. You could still be called in for a night shift the next night. If you are not called in, you are relieved at ~3pm with the Day Jeopardy resident. You do not come in on weekends unless called in for a jeopardy shift. 

If a 24-hour ICU shift needs to be covered, the day and night jeopardy residents will split the ICU shift in half (7-7).
